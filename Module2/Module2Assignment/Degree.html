        <h2>ASSOCIATE</h2>

        <p>
          As of 2022, I plan to recieve my Associate degree in Computer Science
          has been so interesting to learn. </p>
          <p>I love learning about the different
            functions, but so far my favorite type of programming that I have
            learned is the Web Programming I found that I love have the oportunity
            to create and be creative.</p>
          <p>I graduate at the end of 2022. I hope to be able to maintain good grades during 
            this time. While it has been hard to maintain good grades. I have been doing my best and I can not wait to recieve
            my associates degree. 
            </p> 
            <p> Attending Pearl River Community has been amazing and it is one of the best decisions that I have ever made.</p>
        
        <h3>BACHELORS</h3>
      <p>
        I am going to get my bachelors and masters at the Univeristy Southern
        Mississippi. </p> 
        <p>I plan to attend there until I recieve my masters. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3> MASTERS</h3>
        <p>While
          recieving my masters, I hope to be able to get a job programming, since
          I already know the basics.</p>
