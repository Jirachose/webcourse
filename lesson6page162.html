      Breaking news, also known as a special report or news bulletin, is a
      current issue that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of
      scheduled programming and or current news in order to report its details.
      Its use if also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a
      story that being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide
      interest to views and has little impact otherwise.
       Many times, breaking
      news is used after the news network had been already reported on this
      story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and
      phrase " Just In" is sometimes used instead.</p>
    <p class="para">
      In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commmonly sketchy,
      usually due to the limited information available the time. For example,
      during the the Sago Mine disaster, initial reports were that all twelve
      miners were found alie, but news organizations later found only one
      actually survived.

    <p class="para">
      Another criticism has been diluting of the importance of breakinf news by
      the need of 24-hour news channels to fill time, applying the title to soft
      news stories of questionable imortance and urgency, for example, car
      chases Others question whether the use of the term is excessive, citing
      occasions when the term is used even though scheduled programming is not
      interupted.
