                I was introduced to this show through  <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: red;">NETFLIX</span>, and it was amazing. I mean who does not like 
                a good Historical  Romantic Fictional Drama. This show was slimpy splendid and the drama was top-tier

              <td> <span style="font-style: italic;">SQUID GAMES</span> is the type of show that you have to watched
                multiple times, because there is so much symbolism in the show that you might 
                have missed the first time of around. This show was one of the best shows 
                that  <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: red;">NETFLIX</span> created in <span style="font-weight: bold;">2021</span>
